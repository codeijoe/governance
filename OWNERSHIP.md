# Intellectual Property & Liability

## 1. The "Upstream" Rule (Code Ownership)
By submitting a Pull Request (PR) to any Codeijoe repository:
* You agree that your contribution is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**.
* You grant Codeijoe™ and the community a perpetual, world-wide, royalty-free license to use, modify, and distribute the code.
* **Patent Grant:** You provide an implicit patent grant, preventing future litigation over contributed logic.

## 2. Portfolio Rights (Moral Rights)
Codeijoe acknowledges that the **credit** belongs to the Challenger.
* You retain the moral right to claim your work as part of your personal portfolio ("Proof of Work").
* You are encouraged to fork your successful missions to your personal profile to showcase your competency.

## 3. Content Licensing
* **Code:** Apache 2.0.
* **Documentation/Specs/Missions:** Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 (**CC BY-SA 4.0**). This ensures that Codeijoe's curriculum cannot be walled off or sold without attribution.

## 4. Liability Waiver (The "As-Is" Clause)
**WARNING:**
The Codeijoe Proving Ground is a simulation of real-world engineering challenges.
* All materials, automated feedback, and code reviews are provided **"AS IS"** without warranty of any kind.
* The Codeijoe Founder and Maintainers are **NOT LIABLE** for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your participation.
* There is **NO** employment, agency, or contractor relationship established between Codeijoe and any Challenger.

## 5. Platform Integrity
The Codeijoe Proving Ground architecture—its mission structure, CI/CD logic, and repository scaffolding—is exclusive to `github.com/codeijoe`.
* **Prohibited:** Replication of this automated ecosystem **within GitHub**, under any name, is strictly prohibited as it fragments the community and creates platform confusion.
* **Permitted:** Forking code for study, personal portfolio, or use in **non-GitHub environments** (e.g., GitLab, Self-Hosted) is permitted under the stated licenses.
