# Codeijoe™ Governance Model

> **Authority:** Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL)
> **Philosophy:** Automated Engineering Proving Ground
> **Established:** 2024

## 1. The Power Structure
Codeijoe is not a democracy; it is a meritocratic dictatorship designed for speed and consistency.

### The Ops Commander (BDFL)
* **Who:** The Project Founder.
* **Power:** Absolute veto on technical architecture, brand direction, and governance policies.
* **Role:** To protect the "Proving Ground" integrity from dilution (e.g., lowering standards for ease).

### The Maintainers (Gatekeepers)
* **Who:** Invited contributors who have proven their "Engineering Judgment."
* **Power:** Merge rights, triage issues, and review code quality.
* **Restriction:** Cannot alter the Core Constitution or Licensing without BDFL ratification.

### The Challengers (Community)
* **Who:** Any developer submitting code to prove their skills.
* **Rights:** Fork, Submit PR, Propose RFCs.
* **Role:** To solve missions, not to demand tutorials.

## 2. Decision Making: The RFC Process
Major changes (e.g., new language tracks, changing CI/CD logic) must follow the **Request for Comments (RFC)** protocol.

1.  **Open Issue:** Create an issue with label `RFC`.
2.  **Proposal:** Detail the *Context*, *Problem*, and *Solution*.
3.  **Debate:** Community discusses technical merits.
4.  **Verdict:** BDFL issues a final ruling: `ACCEPTED`, `REJECTED`, or `DEFERRED`.

*Note: "Bike-shedding" (arguing over trivial details) will result in the issue being locked.*

## 3. Enforcement
* Automation is the first line of defense. If CI fails, Governance does not apply—the code is simply invalid.
* Humans only review code that has passed the automated gauntlet.
