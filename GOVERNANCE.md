# Governance Model: Enlightened BDFL

Codeijoe operates under the **Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL)** model. While we value community input, final strategic and technical authority rests with the Project Founder.

## Roles

### 1. The Ops Commander (BDFL)
* **Authority:** Absolute veto power over technical architecture, roadmap, and governance.
* **Responsibility:** Ensuring the platform remains "Low Cost, High Leverage" and consistent with the Proving Ground philosophy.

### 2. Maintainers (The Gatekeepers)
* **Authority:** Can Review PRs, Request Changes, and Merge approved code.
* **Selection:** Invite-only. Chosen based on technical excellence and consistency.

### 3. Challengers (Contributors)
* **Rights:** Can Fork, Submit PRs, and participate in RFC discussions.
* **Limit:** Cannot merge their own code.

## Decision Making Process (RFC)
Major changes to the platform (e.g., adding a new language track, changing CI/CD logic) must go through the **Request For Comments (RFC)** process:

1. Open an Issue with label `RFC`.
2. Detail the technical proposal.
3. Community discusses.
4. **Ops Commander makes the final decision:** `Accepted`, `Rejected`, or `Deferred`.

**Consensus is preferred, but BDFL decision is final.**
