# BRANDING.md — Codeijoe Project

**Version**: 1.0  
**Effective Date**: 2025-11-25  

## 1. Brand Identity

“**Codeijoe**” is a registered project identifier owned by Indra Wahyudi. It designates a specific open mentorship system built exclusively on the GitHub platform.

## 2. Permitted Use

- **Forking source code** is permitted under the terms of the Apache License 2.0.
- **Deployment to non-GitHub platforms** (e.g., GitLab, Bitbucket, internal systems) is allowed, **provided**:
  - The name “Codeijoe” is **not used** in any form.
  - No implication of affiliation, endorsement, or continuity is made.
  - The original LICENSE and copyright notices are retained.

## 3. Prohibited Use

**Replication of the Codeijoe mentorship architecture within GitHub is strictly prohibited**, regardless of naming. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Creating repositories that mimic the structure, issue templates, or automation of Codeijoe tracks
- Deploying a “Codeijoe-like” mentorship system under a different GitHub organization
- Using the same workflow logic (e.g., milestone-based progression, PR review standards) in a public or private GitHub org with the intent to create an alternative instance

**Rationale**: GitHub is the sole official runtime environment for Codeijoe. Any replication within this namespace fragments the mentorship ecosystem, creates user confusion, and constitutes a violation of platform integrity.

## 4. Enforcement

Violations will be addressed through:
- Immediate rejection of support or collaboration
- Reporting to GitHub Abuse pursuant to the [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies)
- Legal action where trademark rights have been asserted or registered
