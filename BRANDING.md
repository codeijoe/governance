# Codeijoe™ Brand Identity & Guidelines

> **Tagline:** "Where AI falls short."
> **Identity:** The Engineering Proving Ground.
> **Since:** November 5, 2024 (First Commercial Use).

## 1. The Core Narrative
Codeijoe exists to validate the **human edge** in software engineering.
* **AI (LLMs)** are excellent at syntax and boilerplate.
* **Engineers** are required for context, architectural decisions, and maintaining legacy systems.

**Codeijoe tests for Context & Decision Making.** We do not test for memorized syntax.

## 2. Terminology Enforcement (Strict)
To maintain the high-stakes environment, the following terminology replacement is mandatory across all repos:

| BANNED TERM ❌ | REQUIRED TERM ✅ | REASON |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mentorship** | **Proving Ground / Verification** | We do not hold hands; we test skills. |
| **Mentee/Student** | **Challenger** | Passive vs. Active mindset. |
| **Teacher/Mentor** | **Reviewer/Maintainer** | Objective code review, not subjective teaching. |
| **Homework/Task** | **Mission / Protocol** | Industrial framing over academic framing. |

## 3. Visual & Voice
* **Tone:** Stoic, Professional, "The Mountain Engineer". No fluff, no excessive emojis.
* **Logo Usage:** The logo must remain consistent with the minimalist terminal aesthetic.

## 4. Legal & Trademark Usage
The name **"Codeijoe"** is a common law trademark of **Indra Wahyudi**.
* On its **first mention in any document**, it must be marked as **Codeijoe™** to assert trademark rights.
* The logo and visual identity are the exclusive property of the trademark holder and may not be modified without permission.
