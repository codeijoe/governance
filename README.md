# Codeijoe Open Mentorship

**GitHub Organization**: [`github.com/codeijoe`](https://github.com/codeijoe)  
**Founded**: November 5, 2024  
**Owner**: Indra Wahyudi (`itwahjoedi`)

## Vision

Codeijoe is an **open mentorship platform built entirely on GitHub**.  
It treats the GitHub Organization as a **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)**, where learning, collaboration, and project management occur exclusively through Issues, Discussions, and Actions.

## Core Principles

- **Standardization enables scale**: Every mentee operates in a structured repository with identical workflows.
- **Automation is mandatory**: No manual coordination; everything is driven by GitHub Actions.
- **Brand integrity is non-negotiable**: The Codeijoe system is exclusive to this organization.
- **Transparency by default**: All mentorship is public, auditable, and reproducible.

## Governance

This project is governed by explicit, versioned policies:
- [`OWNERSHIP.md`](OWNERSHIP.md) — Declaration of intellectual property
- [`BRANDING.md`](BRANDING.md) — Rules for permitted and prohibited use
- [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) — Apache 2.0 for code; all rights reserved for brand and architecture

## Warning

Replicating the Codeijoe mentorship architecture **within GitHub**—even under a different name—is **strictly prohibited** and will be treated as a violation of platform integrity.

Forking code for use **outside GitHub** is permitted under the terms of the LICENSE.
