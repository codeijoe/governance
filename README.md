## The Proving Ground Philosophy
Codeijoe is **NOT** a mentorship platform or a coding school. We do not provide tutorials, hand-holding, or career counseling.

**Codeijoe is an Automated Engineering Proving Ground.**

We provide the infrastructure (Challenges, CI/CD Pipelines, and Specs). You provide the code. If your code passes our automated gauntlet and human review, you earn the right to merge—and the proof of competence that comes with it.

## Repository Structure
This repository contains the global policies governing the Codeijoe ecosystem:

* **[GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md)**: The "Benevolent Dictator" structure and decision-making process.
* **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)**: The strict rules of engagement for Challengers.
* **[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**: Standards of professional behavior.

## Legal Disclaimer & Waiver
**READ CAREFULLY:**
By interacting with this ecosystem, you acknowledge that all materials and automated feedback are provided **"AS IS"** without warranty of any kind. Codeijoe maintainers are not liable for any direct or indirect damages resulting from the use of this platform. This is an open-source educational environment; use it at your own risk.

## Contact

* **Security Issues:** Open a Draft Security Advisory.
* **Platform Disputes:** File an Issue with label `governance`.
* **"How do I code this?" questions:** **DO NOT ASK HERE.** StackOverflow exists for that.
