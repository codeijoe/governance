## The Proving Ground Philosophy
Codeijoe is **NOT** a mentorship platform or a coding school. We do not provide tutorials, hand-holding, or career counseling.

**Codeijoe is an Automated Engineering Proving Ground.**

In an era of AI-generated code, the value of a developer is no longer syntax—it is judgment. We exist to **validate your human edge**: Context, Decision Making, and Architectural Resilience.

We provide the infrastructure (Challenges, CI/CD Pipelines, and Specs). You provide the code. If your code passes our automated gauntlet and human review, you earn the right to merge—and the proof of competence that comes with it.
