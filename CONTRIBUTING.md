# Rules of Engagement

**Welcome to the Proving Ground.**
You are here to test your skills, not to be taught.

## The Workflow
1. **Fork** the Challenge Repository.
2. **Solve** the problem locally.
3. **Test** locally. If `npm test` fails locally, **DO NOT** open a PR.
4. **Submit PR** only when you are confident.

## The "Zero-Touch" Policy
We utilize aggressive automation.
* If your PR fails the CI/CD Pipeline (Linter/Tests), it will be **automatically ignored** by humans.
* Do not tag Maintainers asking "Why did my test fail?". Read the logs. Debugging is part of the challenge.

## Legal & IP Rights
By submitting a Pull Request to Codeijoe:
1. You certify that the code is your original work.
2. You grant Codeijoe a perpetual, world-wide, royalty-free license to use, display, and distribute your contribution under the **Apache License 2.0**.
3. You retain moral rights to claim this work in your personal portfolio.

## Prohibited Behavior
* **Spoilers:** Do not post full solutions in Issues/Discussions.
* **Begging:** Do not ask for easy passes or manual fixes.
